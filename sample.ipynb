      "    * `self`: The instance of the class.\n",
      "    * `role`: An `AgentRole` enum representing the role of the agent (e.g., storyteller, game master).\n",
      "    * `personality`: A dictionary defining the personality traits and communication style of the agent.\n",
      "* **Return Type:** None (constructor)\n",
      "* **Purpose:** Initializes a new LLMAgent with a specific role and personality.  It sets up the agent's role, personality, and initializes an empty conversation history.\n",
      "* **Role:** Creates and configures an agent that can interact within the game using language models.\n",
      "* **How it fits:**  Provides a base for creating different types of agents (storyteller, character, etc.) that can generate dynamic and engaging content.\n",

      "    * `context`: An optional dictionary providing additional context for the response generation.\n",
      "* **Return Type:** `str` (The generated response from the language model.)\n",
      "* **Purpose:** Generates a response from the language model based on the given prompt and context. It constructs a system prompt incorporating the agent's personality and context, then sends the full prompt to the language model.\n",
      "* **Role:** Core function for interacting with the language model, allowing agents to respond to prompts and generate dynamic content.\n",
      "* **How it fits:** Enables the agents to communicate and interact within the game world, driving the narrative and gameplay.\n",

      "    * `context`: An optional dictionary providing context for the system prompt.\n",
      "* **Return Type:** `str` (The constructed system prompt.)\n",
      "* **Purpose:** Constructs the system prompt for the language model, incorporating the agent's role, personality, and any provided context.\n",
      "* **Role:** Helper function to create the initial instructions for the language model, ensuring consistent behavior and personality for the agent.\n",
      "* **How it fits:** Supports `generate_response` by providing the necessary context and instructions to the language model.\n",

      "    * `self`: The instance of the class.\n",
      "* **Return Type:** `str` (A fallback response.)\n",
      "* **Purpose:** Provides a fallback response in case the language model fails to generate a response.\n",
      "* **Role:** Handles error cases and ensures that the game can continue even if the language model encounters issues.\n",
      "* **How it fits:** Improves the robustness of the agent by providing a backup mechanism for response generation.\n",

      "* **Role:** Provides a structured way to represent and manage the different types of agents in the system.\n",
      "* **How it fits:** Used in the `LLMAgent` class to specify the role of each agent, influencing their behavior and interactions.\n",

      "* **Purpose:** Represents an agent powered by a large language model (LLM).  It encapsulates the agent's role, personality, conversation history, and methods for interacting with the LLM.\n",
      "* **Role:** Provides a common interface for creating and managing different types of agents in the game.\n",
      "* **How it fits:** Serves as the foundation for creating intelligent agents that can generate dynamic content and interact with players.\n",
